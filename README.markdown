# Picturize

## What does this do to my chyrp installation?

Picturize adds a simple graphical pane to your chyrp admin panel displaying all uploaded images as thumbnails.

## What do I need to install it?

A chyrp instance of version 2.1 or newer, but 2.5b2 or later being strongly recommended. Also you need to have php-gd installed and enable it in your php.ini file (where it is known as gd.so), which is required to create thumbnails.
